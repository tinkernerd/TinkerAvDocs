# üõ†Ô∏è Aircraft Systems Basics ‚úàÔ∏è
___

Understanding the basic systems of an aircraft is crucial for every pilot. These systems work together to ensure safe and efficient operation during flight. This guide provides an overview of the key systems found in most general aviation aircraft.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Key Aircraft Systems:

# Powerplant (Engine and Propeller)
- **Engine**
	- Provides thrust and powers other aircraft systems.
	- Types:
		- Reciprocating (piston engines): Common in general aviation.
		- Turbine (jet engines): Found in larger aircraft.
	- Systems:
		- Carbureted or fuel-injected for delivering fuel.
		- Air-cooled or liquid-cooled for temperature control.
- **Propeller**
	- Converts engine power into thrust.
	- Fixed-pitch: Simplified, constant blade angle.
	- Variable-pitch: Adjustable blade angle for efficiency.

# Electrical System
- **Components**
	- Battery: Powers systems when the engine is off.
	- Alternator/Generator: Recharges the battery and supplies power during flight.
	- Circuit Breakers: Protect systems from electrical overload.
- **Uses**
	- Powers avionics, lights, and ignition systems.
	- Operates instruments and navigation aids.

# Fuel System
- **Fuel Delivery**
	- Gravity-fed or pump-fed systems.
	- Fuel tanks located in the wings or fuselage.
- **Types of Fuel**
	- AVGAS (Aviation Gasoline) for piston engines.
	- Jet A for turbine engines.
- **Fuel Management**
	- Use proper fuel types and monitor for contamination.
	- Switch tanks to balance fuel during flight.

# Hydraulic System
- **Purpose**
	- Operates high-pressure components like landing gear, flaps, and brakes.
	- Found in larger or more complex aircraft.
- **Components**
	- Pump, reservoir, actuators, and lines.

# Landing Gear System
- **Types**
	- Fixed: Non-retractable and simple.
	- Retractable: Reduces drag for faster flight.
- **Components**
	- Wheels, brakes, and shock absorbers.

# Flight Control System
- **Primary Controls**
	- Ailerons: Control roll.
	- Elevator/Stabilator: Control pitch.
	- Rudder: Controls yaw.
- **Secondary Controls**
	- Flaps: Increase lift or drag for takeoff/landing.
	- Trim: Reduces control pressure for smoother flight.

# Environmental System
- **Cabin Comfort**
	- Heating and cooling systems for temperature control.
	- Pressurization in high-altitude aircraft.
- **Deicing/Anti-Icing**
	- Protects critical surfaces (wings, propeller) from ice buildup.

# Avionics and Navigation Systems
- **Avionics**
	- Radios, transponders, and GPS systems for communication and navigation.
- **Instruments**
	- Basic six-pack: Airspeed, Altimeter, Attitude Indicator, Turn Coordinator, Heading Indicator, Vertical Speed Indicator.
