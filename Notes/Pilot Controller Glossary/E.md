***EMERGENCY-*** A distress or an urgency condition.

</div>

<div>

EMERGENCY AUTOLAND SYSTEM- This system, if activated, will determine an optimal airport, plot a course, broadcast the aircraft's intentions, fly to the airport, land, and (depending on the model) shut down the engines. Though the system will broadcast the aircraft's intentions, the controller should assume that transmissions to the aircraft will not be acknowledged.

</div>

<div>

EMERGENCY DESCENT MODE- This automated system senses conditions conducive to hypoxia (cabin depressurization). If an aircraft is equipped and the system is activated, it is designed to turn the aircraft up to 90 degrees, then descend to a lower altitude and level off, giving the pilot(s) time to recover.

^JEVNRVJHRU5DWSBE

</div>

<div>

EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER (ELT)- A radio transmitter attached to the aircraft structure which operates from its own power source on 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz. It aids in locating downed aircraft by radiating a downward sweeping audio tone, 2-4 times per second. It is designed to function without human action after an accident.

</div>

<div>

ENHANCED FLIGHT VISION SYSTEM (EFVS)- An EFVS is an installed aircraft system which uses an electronic means to provide a display of the forward external scene topography (the natural or man-made features of a place or region especially in a way to show their relative positions and elevation) through the use of imaging sensors, including but not limited to forward-looking infrared, millimeter wave radiometry, millimeter wave radar, or low-light level image intensification. An EFVS includes the display element, sensors, computers and power supplies, indications, and controls. An operator's authorization to conduct an EFVS operation may have provisions which allow pilots to conduct IAPs when the reported weather is below minimums prescribed on the IAP to be flown.

</div>

<div>

EN ROUTE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SERVICES- Air traffic control service provided aircraft on IFR flight plans, generally by centers, when these aircraft are operating between departure and destination terminal areas. When equipment, capabilities, and controller workload permit, certain advisory/assistance services may be provided to VFR aircraft.

</div>

<div>

EN ROUTE AUTOMATION SYSTEM (EAS)- The complex integrated environment consisting of situation display systems, surveillance systems and flight data processing, remote devices, decision support tools, and the related communications equipment that form the heart of the automated IFR air traffic control system. It interfaces with automated terminal systems and is used in the control of en route IFR aircraft.

EN ROUTE CHARTS-

[[A#^JEFFUk9OQVVUSUNB|(See AERONAUTICAL CHART.)]]

</div>

<div>

EN ROUTE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL (EDST)- An automated tool provided at each Radar Associate position in selected En Route facilities. This tool utilizes flight and radar data to determine present and future trajectories for all active and proposal aircraft and provides enhanced automated flight data management.

<div>

EN ROUTE MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE WARNING (E-MSAW)- A function of the EAS that aids the controller by providing an alert when a tracked aircraft is below or predicted by the computer to go below a predetermined minimum IFR altitude (MIA).

^JEVOIFJPVVRFIE1J

<div>

EN ROUTE SPACING PROGRAM (ESP)- A program designed to assist the exit sector in achieving the required in-trail spacing.

^JEVOIFJPVVRFIFNQ

EN ROUTE TRANSITION-

<!-- -->

1.  Conventional STARs/SIDs. The portion of a SID/STAR that connects to one or more en route airway/jet route.
2.  RNAV STARs/SIDs. The portion of a STAR preceding the common route or point, or for a SID the portion following, that is coded for a specific en route fix, airway or jet route.

EST-  
[[E#^JEVTVElNQVRFRA|(See ESTIMATED.)]]

</div>

<div>

ESTABLISHED- To be stable or fixed at an altitude or on a course, route, route segment, heading, instrument approach or departure procedure, etc.

</div>

<div>

ESTABLISHED ON RNP (EoR) CONCEPT- A system of authorized instrument approaches, ATC procedures, surveillance, and communication requirements that allow aircraft operations to be safely conducted with approved reduced separation criteria once aircraft are established on a PBN segment of a published instrument flight procedure.

</div>

<div>

ESTIMATED (EST)-When used in NOTAMs “EST” is a contraction that is used by the issuing authority only when the condition is expected to return to service prior to the expiration time. Using “EST” lets the user know that this NOTAM has the possibility of returning to service earlier than the expiration time. Any NOTAM which includes an “EST” will be auto-expired at the designated expiration time.

ESTIMATED ELAPSED TIME \[ICAO\]- The estimated time required to proceed from one significant point to another.

***EXECUTE MISSED APPROACH-*** Instructions issued to a pilot making an instrument approach which means continue inbound to the missed approach point and execute the missed approach procedure as described on the Instrument Approach Procedure Chart or as previously assigned by ATC. The pilot may climb immediately to the altitude specified in the missed approach procedure upon making a missed approach. No turns should be initiated prior to reaching the missed approach point. When conducting an ASR or PAR approach, execute the assigned missed approach procedure immediately upon receiving instructions to “execute missed approach.”

[[00 Index|(Refer to AIM.)]]

<div>

***EXPECT (ALTITUDE) AT (TIME) or (FIX)-*** Used under certain conditions to provide a pilot with an altitude to be used in the event of two-way communications failure. It also provides altitude information to assist the pilot in planning.

Expedite climb/descent normally indicates to a pilot that the approximate best rate of climb/descent should be used without requiring an exceptional change in aircraft handling characteristics.
