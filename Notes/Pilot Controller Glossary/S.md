SAFETY ALERT- A safety alert issued by ATC to aircraft under their control if ATC is aware the aircraft is at an altitude which, in the controller's judgment, places the aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain, obstructions, or other aircraft. The controller may discontinue the issuance of further alerts if the pilot advises he/she is taking action to correct the situation or has the other aircraft in sight.

<!-- -->

1.  Terrain/Obstruction Alert- A safety alert issued by ATC to aircraft under their control if ATC is aware the aircraft is at an altitude which, in the controller's judgment, places the aircraft in unsafe proximity to terrain/obstructions; e.g., “Low Altitude Alert, check your altitude immediately.”
2.  Aircraft Conflict Alert- A safety alert issued by ATC to aircraft under their control if ATC is aware of an aircraft that is not under their control at an altitude which, in the controller's judgment, places both aircraft in unsafe proximity to each other. With the alert, ATC will offer the pilot an alternate course of action when feasible; e.g., “Traffic Alert, advise you turn right heading zero niner zero or climb to eight thousand immediately.”

2.  FALSE ALERT-
    1.  Alerts generated by one or more false surface-radar targets that the system has interpreted as real tracks and placed into safety logic.
    2.  Alerts in which the safety logic software did not perform correctly, based upon the design specifications and the current set of Safety Logic parameters.
    3.  The alert is generated by surface radar targets caused by moderate or greater precipitation.
3.  NUISANCE ALERT- An alert in which one or more of the following is true:
    1.  The alert is generated by a known situation that is not considered an unsafe operation, such as LAHSO or other approved operations.
    2.  The alert is generated by inaccurate secondary radar data received by the Safety Logic System.
    3.  One or more of the aircraft involved in the alert is not intending to use a runway (for example, helicopter, pipeline patrol, non-Mode C overflight, etc.).
4.  VALID NON-ALERT- A situation in which the safety logic software correctly determines that an alert is not required, based upon the design specifications and the current set of Safety Logic parameters.
5.  I NVALID NON-ALERT- A situation in which the safety logic software did not issue an alert when an alert was required, based upon the design specifications.

1.  Substitute routes which are shown on U.S. Government charts.
2.  Routes defined by ATC as specific NAVAID radials or courses.
3.  Routes defined by ATC as direct to or between NAVAIDs.

<div>

SURVEILLANCE APPROACH- An instrument approach wherein the air traffic controller issues instructions, for pilot compliance, based on aircraft position in relation to the final approach course (azimuth), and the distance (range) from the end of the runway as displayed on the controller's radar scope. The controller will provide recommended altitudes on final approach if requested by the pilot.
