WAYPOINT- A predetermined geographical position used for route/instrument approach definition, progress reports, published VFR routes, visual reporting points or points for transitioning and/or circumnavigating controlled and/or special use airspace, that is defined relative to a VORTAC station or in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates.

WEATHER ADVISORY- In aviation weather forecast practice, an expression of hazardous weather conditions not predicted in the Aviation Surface Forecast, Aviation Cloud Forecast, or area forecast, as they affect the operation of air traffic and as prepared by the NWS.

WEATHER RECONNAISSANCE AREA (WRA)- A WRA is airspace with defined dimensions and published by Notice to Airmen, which is established to support weather reconnaissance/research flights. Air traffic control services are not provided within WRAs. Only participating weather reconnaissance/research aircraft from the 53<sup>rd</sup> Weather Reconnaissance Squadron and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Aircraft Operations Center are permitted to operate within a WRA. A WRA may only be established in airspace within U.S. Flight Information Regions outside of U.S. territorial airspace.

***WHEN ABLE-***

<!-- -->

1.  In conjunction with ATC instructions, gives the pilot the latitude to delay compliance until a condition or event has been reconciled. Unlike “pilot discretion,” when instructions are prefaced “when able,” the pilot is expected to seek the first opportunity to comply.
2.  In conjunction with a weather deviation clearance, requires the pilot to determine when he/she is clear of weather, then execute ATC instructions.
3.  Once a maneuver has been initiated, the pilot is expected to continue until the specifications of the instructions have been met. “When able,” should not be used when expeditious compliance is required.

<div>

WIDE-AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (WAAS)- The WAAS is a satellite navigation system consisting of the equipment and software which augments the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The WAAS provides enhanced integrity, accuracy, availability, and continuity over and above GPS SPS. The differential correction function provides improved accuracy required for precision approach.

WIDE AREA MULTILATERATION (WAM)- A distributed surveillance technology which may utilize any combination of signals from Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) (Modes A and C) and Mode S transponders, and ADS-B transmissions. Multiple geographically dispersed ground sensors measure the time-of-arrival of the transponder messages. Aircraft position is determined by joint processing of the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements computed between a reference and the ground stations' measured time-of-arrival.

WIND GRID DISPLAY- A display that presents the latest forecasted wind data overlaid on a map of the ARTCC area. Wind data is automatically entered and updated periodically by transmissions from the National Weather Service. Winds at specific altitudes, along with temperatures and air pressure can be viewed.

</div>

<div>

WIND SHEAR- A change in wind speed and/or wind direction in a short distance resulting in a tearing or shearing effect. It can exist in a horizontal or vertical direction and occasionally in both.

</div>

<div>

WIND SHEAR ESCAPE- An unplanned abortive maneuver initiated by the pilot in command (PIC) as a result of onboard cockpit systems. Wind shear escapes are characterized by maximum thrust climbs in the low altitude terminal environment until wind shear conditions are no longer detected.

***WORDS TWICE-***

<!-- -->

1.  As a request: “Communication is difficult. Please say every phrase twice.”
2.  As information: “Since communications are difficult, every phrase in this message will be spoken twice.”
