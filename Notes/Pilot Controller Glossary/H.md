HIGH SPEED EXIT-

[[H#^JEhJR0ggU1BFRUQg|(See HIGH SPEED TAXIWAY.)]]

</div>

<div>

HIGH SPEED TAXIWAY- A long radius taxiway designed and provided with lighting or marking to define the path of aircraft, traveling at high speed (up to 60 knots), from the runway center to a point on the center of a taxiway. Also referred to as long radius exit or turn-off taxiway. The high speed taxiway is designed to expedite aircraft turning off the runway after landing, thus reducing runway occupancy time.

<div>

HIGH SPEED TURNOFF-

[[H#^JEhJR0ggU1BFRUQg|(See HIGH SPEED TAXIWAY.)]]

</div>

<div>

HOLD FOR RELEASE- Used by ATC to delay an aircraft for traffic management reasons; i.e., weather, traffic volume, etc. Hold for release instructions (including departure delay information) are used to inform a pilot or a controller (either directly or through an authorized relay) that an IFR departure clearance is not valid until a release time or additional instructions have been received.

[[H#^JEhPTERJTkcgUE9J|(See ICAO term HOLDING POINT.)]]

</div>

<div>

HOLD-IN-LIEU OF PROCEDURE TURN- A hold-in-lieu of procedure turn shall be established over a final or intermediate fix when an approach can be made from a properly aligned holding pattern. The hold-in-lieu of procedure turn permits the pilot to align with the final or intermediate segment of the approach and/or descend in the holding pattern to an altitude that will permit a normal descent to the final approach fix altitude. The hold-in-lieu of procedure turn is a required maneuver (the same as a procedure turn) unless the aircraft is being radar vectored to the final approach course, when “NoPT” is shown on the approach chart, or when the pilot requests or the controller advises the pilot to make a “straight-in” approach.

</div>

<div>

HOLD PROCEDURE- A predetermined maneuver which keeps aircraft within a specified airspace while awaiting further clearance from air traffic control. Also used during ground operations to keep aircraft within a specified area or at a specified point while awaiting further clearance from air traffic control.

<div>

HOLD-SHORT POSITION LIGHTS- Flashing in-pavement white lights located at specified hold-short points.

<div>

HOMING \[ICAO\]- The procedure of using the direction-finding equipment of one radio station with the emission of another radio station, where at least one of the stations is mobile, and whereby the mobile station proceeds continuously towards the other station.

HOVER CHECK- Used to describe when a helicopter/VTOL aircraft requires a stabilized hover to conduct a performance/power check prior to hover taxi, air taxi, or takeoff. Altitude of the hover will vary based on the purpose of the check.

^JEhPVkVSIENIRUNL

</div>

<div>

HOVER TAXI- Used to describe a helicopter/VTOL aircraft movement conducted above the surface and in ground effect at airspeeds less than approximately 20 knots. The actual height may vary, and some helicopters may require hover taxi above 25 feet AGL to reduce ground effect turbulence or provide clearance for cargo slingloads.
