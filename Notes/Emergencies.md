# üö® Emergencies in Aviation ‚úàÔ∏è
___

Emergencies in aviation are rare but require quick thinking and adherence to procedures. This guide covers common emergencies, best practices, and resources to help pilots manage unexpected situations.

## üõë Key Emergency Concepts for Pilots:

# Types of Emergencies
- **Engine Failure**
	- Practice forced landings and know your best glide speed.
	- Example: "Engine failure during takeoff" procedures.
- **Electrical Failures**
	- Partial or complete loss of electrical systems.
	- Use standby instruments and hand-held radios if equipped.
- **Fuel Emergencies**
	- Monitor fuel consumption and plan diversions early.
	- Declare "minimum fuel" or "fuel emergency" as needed.
- **Loss of Communications (NORDO)**
	- Troubleshoot headset and radio issues.
	- Follow the light gun signals at towered airports.
- **Fire Onboard**
	- Execute fire procedures for engine or cabin fires.
	- Use fire extinguishers and vent smoke if possible.

# Emergency Communications
- **Mayday Calls**
	- Used for life-threatening emergencies.
	- Example: "Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, N12345, engine failure, 10 miles east of XYZ airport, altitude 3,000 feet."
- **Pan-Pan Calls**
	- For non-life-threatening but urgent situations.
	- Example: "Pan-Pan, Pan-Pan, Pan-Pan, N12345, lost navigation equipment."
- **Transponder Codes**
	- 7700: General emergency.
	- 7600: Communication failure.
	- 7500: Hijacking.

# Emergency Landing
- **Forced Landing**
	- Select a suitable landing site (e.g., fields, roads).
	- Secure the aircraft and notify ATC if possible.
- **Ditching**
	- Prepare for water landings with life vests and flotation devices.
	- Brief passengers on evacuation procedures.

# Checklist Usage
- **Memory Items**
	- Immediate actions from memory (e.g., "Fuel selector: OFF" in an engine fire).
- **Emergency Checklists**
	- Reference the aircraft POH or QRH for detailed steps.

# Survival After Landing
- **Post-Landing Safety**
	- Evacuate passengers quickly and safely.
	- Activate ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter).
- **Emergency Kits**
	- Include food, water, first aid, and signaling devices.
