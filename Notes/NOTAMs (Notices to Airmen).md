# üìù Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) üì¢
___

NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen) are critical pieces of information that every pilot must review before a flight. They provide real-time updates on conditions and restrictions that could affect your flight. This guide covers the types of NOTAMs and offers resources to ensure you're always up to date.

## üõ¨ Key NOTAM Concepts for Pilots:

# Types of NOTAMs
- **D (Distance) NOTAMs**
	- Contain information about airports, navigation aids, services, and facilities.
	- Example: Runway closures or unserviceable taxiways.

- **FDC (Flight Data Center) NOTAMs**
	- Regulatory notices such as airspace restrictions or amendments to instrument approach procedures.
	- Example: Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs).

- **Military NOTAMs**
	- Information specific to military operations and facilities.

- **International NOTAMs**
	- Pertinent to flights outside the United States, detailing airspace restrictions, weather-related issues, or other international concerns.

# Common NOTAM Subjects
- Runway and taxiway closures.
- Changes in lighting systems (e.g., beacon or PAPI outages).
- Temporary obstacles like cranes near airports.
- Airspace restrictions, including TFRs for VIP movements or special events.
- NAVAID outages or irregularities.
- GPS testing or outages affecting navigation.

# How to Read NOTAMs
- **Example NOTAM:**
	`!JFK 12/045 JFK RWY 4L/22R CLSD 1901121200-1901121800`
	- `!JFK`: The affected location.
	- `12/045`: The NOTAM number.
	- `JFK RWY 4L/22R`: The runway in question.
	- `CLSD`: The closure status.
	- `1901121200-1901121800`: The effective date and time (Zulu).

# Accessing NOTAMs
- Always review NOTAMs during preflight planning.
- Use online tools, aviation apps, or consult ATC for the latest information.
