# üõ°Ô∏è Aviation Safety üåü
___

Safety is the foundation of aviation and is emphasized at every level, from preflight planning to postflight debriefing. This guide covers essential safety concepts, procedures, and resources to ensure you operate safely and efficiently.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Safety Concepts for Pilots:

# Preflight Safety
- **Thorough Inspections**
	- Conduct detailed preflight checks to ensure the aircraft is airworthy.
	- Verify fuel, oil, and hydraulic levels, as well as control surfaces.
- **Weather Briefings**
	- Review METARs, TAFs, and NOTAMs to avoid hazardous weather conditions.
- **Passenger Briefings**
	- Communicate emergency procedures, seatbelt usage, and safety protocols.

# In-Flight Safety
- **Situational Awareness**
	- Stay aware of your surroundings, including airspace, weather, and traffic.
	- Use tools like ADS-B and TCAS for enhanced traffic awareness.
- **Avoiding Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT)**
	- Use terrain awareness systems and maintain safe altitudes.
- **Collision Avoidance**
	- Follow ‚Äúsee and avoid‚Äù principles during VFR flights.
	- Adhere to ATC instructions and right-of-way rules.

# Postflight Safety
- **Aircraft Securing**
	- Tie down the aircraft and secure all covers and locks.
	- Log any issues discovered during the flight for maintenance follow-up.
- **Postflight Debriefing**
	- Review the flight to identify areas for improvement and enhance future safety.

# Personal Safety
- **IMSAFE Checklist**
	- Evaluate your fitness to fly:
		- Illness
		- Medication
		- Stress
		- Alcohol
		- Fatigue
		- Emotion
- **Personal Minimums**
	- Establish your own safety limits for weather, wind, and other conditions.

# Safety Culture
- **Sterile Cockpit**
	- Limit non-essential conversations during critical phases of flight.
- **Risk Management**
	- Use tools like the PAVE and 3P models to assess and mitigate risks.
		- PAVE: Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, External Pressures.
		- 3P: Perceive, Process, Perform.

# Common Safety Hazards
- **Runway Incursions**
	- Always read back ATC instructions and verify clearances.
- **Wildlife Hazards**
	- Use bird strike avoidance techniques and notify ATC of hazards.
- **Foreign Object Debris (FOD)**
	- Inspect ramps and taxiways for loose debris that could damage the aircraft.
