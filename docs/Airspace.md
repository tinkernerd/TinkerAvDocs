# ‚úàÔ∏è Understanding Airspace üåå
___

Airspace is the invisible structure of the skies, governing how and where aircraft can operate. Knowing airspace classifications and requirements is critical for every pilot. This guide breaks down the types of airspace and offers resources to help you fly safely and within the rules.

## üõ´ Key Airspace Concepts for Pilots:

# Controlled Airspace
- **Class A**  
	- From 18,000 feet MSL up to FL600.
	- IFR flights only.
- **Class B**  
	- Surrounds major airports; think "big and busy."
	- Requires clearance and a Mode C transponder.
- **Class C**  
	- Medium-sized airports.
	- Requires radio contact and Mode C transponder.
- **Class D**  
	- Small towered airports.
	- Requires radio contact.
- **Class E**  
	- Covers much of the airspace from 1,200 feet AGL to 18,000 feet MSL.
	- Used for IFR and VFR operations.

# Uncontrolled Airspace
- **Class G**
	- Typically below 1,200 feet AGL (varies in some areas).
	- VFR pilots self-separate; no ATC services.

# Special Use Airspace
- **MOA (Military Operations Area)**  
	- Active MOAs require caution; military training often occurs here.
- **Restricted Areas**  
	- Flight permitted only with prior clearance due to hazardous activities.
- **Prohibited Areas**  
	- No flight allowed (e.g., over the White House).
- **Warning Areas**  
	- Located over international waters; similar to MOAs.
- **TFR (Temporary Flight Restriction)**  
	- Areas temporarily restricted for events or emergencies.

# Other Airspace Types
- **Alert Areas**  
	- High volume of pilot training or unusual aerial activity.
- **Controlled Firing Areas**  
	- Activities cease when aircraft are detected.
- **National Security Areas (NSAs)**  
	- Recommended avoidance due to security concerns.

# Airspace Communication and Equipment Requirements
- **Mode C Veil**  
	- Transponder required within 30 nautical miles of Class B airports.
- **Two-Way Radio Communication**  
	- Required for Class B, C, and D airspace.
- **VFR Weather Minimums**  
	- Specific visibility and cloud clearance requirements based on airspace class.

# Airspace Charts
- Use sectional charts to understand airspace boundaries and altitudes.

Respect airspace boundaries and always check NOTAMs before flight. Remember: The sky is big, but the rules keep us all safe!
