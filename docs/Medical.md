# ü©∫ Health & Medical Considerations in Aviation üå§Ô∏è
___

A pilot‚Äôs health and medical fitness are critical to ensuring safe operations. From understanding the effects of altitude to meeting medical certification requirements, this guide provides essential knowledge and resources to keep you flying safely.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Health & Medical Concepts for Pilots:

# Medical Certification
- **Classes of Medical Certificates**
	- **Class 1**: For airline transport pilots (ATP).
	- **Class 2**: For commercial pilots.
	- **Class 3**: For private pilots.
	- Special Issuance: For pilots with disqualifying conditions but deemed fit under specific conditions.
- **BasicMed**
	- Alternative to traditional FAA medical certification for eligible private pilots.
	- Requires a physician‚Äôs exam and an online course every 24 calendar months.

# Physical Effects of Flying
- **Hypoxia**
	- Lack of oxygen at altitude; symptoms include confusion, fatigue, and cyanosis.
	- Use supplemental oxygen above 12,500 feet (MSL) after 30 minutes, and above 14,000 feet (MSL) continuously.
- **Decompression Sickness**
	- Occurs when nitrogen in the blood expands during rapid altitude changes.
	- Avoid flying within 24 hours of scuba diving.
- **Vision Issues**
	- Night vision takes 30 minutes to fully adapt; avoid bright lights before night flights.
	- Be aware of spatial disorientation and illusions in low visibility.

# Mental Health and Flying
- **Stress and Fatigue**
	- Use the IMSAFE checklist to assess readiness to fly.
		- Illness
		- Medication
		- Stress
		- Alcohol
		- Fatigue
		- Emotion
- **Psychological Fitness**
	- Address anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns with a medical professional.
	- FAA has pathways for pilots managing mental health conditions.

# In-Flight Medical Emergencies
- **Medical Kits**
	- Include basic first aid, oxygen masks, and AEDs if possible.
- **Recognizing Symptoms**
	- Know the signs of stroke, heart attack, or other serious conditions in passengers.
- **Immediate Actions**
	- Notify ATC of medical emergencies to coordinate assistance.
	- Consider diverting to the nearest airport with medical facilities.

# Nutrition and Hydration
- **Hydration**
	- Drink water regularly to avoid dehydration, especially in high-altitude, low-humidity environments.
- **Food Choices**
	- Avoid heavy, greasy meals before flying to prevent gastrointestinal distress.
